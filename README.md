Create a txt file (named IMOS.txt) that extracts altimeter data from the Australian Ocean Data Network (https://portal.aodn.org.au/search). This data is compiled by Ribal and Young (2019) and regularly updated using calibrated altimeter data from 1985-present.
Select IMOS-SRS Surface Waves Sub-Facility - altimeter wave/wind data, and select spatial and temporal bounding boxes for area of interest. Press next, and select "Download as...", selecting "List of URLs". Save and rename this file as "IMOS.txt", which will be used in Notebook1-Define Area.
