# Altimeter_waves
Determine short term wave conditions and long term wave climate from satellite radar altimeters. Can also be used to determine wind, however not explicitly discussed in this project.
 
Create a txt file (named IMOS.txt) that extracts altimeter data in 1° x 1° URL files from the Australian Ocean Data Network (https://portal.aodn.org.au/search). This data is compiled by Ribal and Young (2019) and regularly updated using calibrated altimeter data from 1985-present.
Select IMOS-SRS Surface Waves Sub-Facility - altimeter wave/wind data, and select spatial and temporal bounding boxes for area of interest. Press next, and select "Download as...", selecting "List of URLs". Save and rename this file as "IMOS.txt", which will be used in Notebook1-Define Area.
